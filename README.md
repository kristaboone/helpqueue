# Help Queue (HQ)

### Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a web application for instructors and TAs to assist students during the class.
With the increased use of scale-up rooms in the WSU curriculum, there is an growing need to organize the Q&A system.
With HQ, students will be able to place themselves in the wait queue, and the instructor/TA will be able to see who
is next in the queue to assist!
